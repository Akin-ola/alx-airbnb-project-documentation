1. User Management

    User Registration:
        Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
        Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    User Login and Authentication:
        Implement login via email and password.
        Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
    Profile Management:
        Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

2. Property Listings Management

    Add Listings:
        Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
    Edit/Delete Listings:
        Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

3. Search and Filtering

    Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:
        Location
        Price range
        Number of guests
        Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)
    Include pagination for large datasets.

4. Booking Management

    Booking Creation:
        Guests can book a property for specified dates.
        Prevent double bookings using date validation.
    Booking Cancellation:
        Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
    Booking Status:
        Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

5. Payment Integration

    Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
        Upfront payments by guests.
        Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
    Include support for multiple currencies.

6. Reviews and Ratings

    Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.
    Hosts can respond to reviews.
    Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.

7. Notifications System

    Implement email and in-app notifications for:
        Booking confirmations
        Cancellations
        Payment updates

8. Admin Dashboard

    Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:
        Users
        Listings
        Bookings
        Payments

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
1. Database Management

    Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
    Required tables:
        Users (guests and hosts)
        Properties
        Bookings
        Reviews
        Payments

2. API Development

    Use RESTful APIs to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
    Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:
        GET (retrieve data)
        POST (create data)
        PUT/PATCH (update data)
        DELETE (remove data)
    Use GraphQL for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).

3. Authentication and Authorization

    Use JWT for secure user sessions.
    Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
        Guests
        Hosts
        Admins

4. File Storage (Scenario based)

    Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage

5. Third-Party Services

    Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.

6. Error Handling and Logging

    Implement global error handling for APIs.

üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements
1. Scalability

    Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.
    Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.

2. Security

    Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.
    Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

3. Performance Optimization

    Use caching tools like Redis to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
    Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

4. Testing

    Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like pytest .
    Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
